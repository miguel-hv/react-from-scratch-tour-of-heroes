# React Tour of Heroes from scratch

Based on [this article](https://blog.usejournal.com/creating-a-react-app-from-scratch-f3c693b84658) I created a react implementation from scratch and I built with React the [Angular's Tour of Heroes tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial) in order to grasp an overall picture of both framework/library.

## Goals met
* Basic understanding of how Webpack works
* Making more clear how Angular and React compare and differ, mainly in inheritance vs composition architecture and the use of Angular services vs React context
* Deepening in discussion about use of context, redux, and composition for managing data flow in React
